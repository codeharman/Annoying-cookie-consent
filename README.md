🍪 Annoying Cookie Consent

A fun little parody project that trolls the user with an over-the-top cookie-consent modal.

## 🚀 Overview

This project displays an annoying cookie consent modal after 3 seconds.
It plays with the user by:

- Repeating a warning paragraph 10 times
- Making the Decline button run away (reversing the button order)
- “Selling” the user’s data in a funny animated sequence
- Showing an epic Barbie GIF at the end

All built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 💻 Technologies Used

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks. Zero dependencies. Pure DOM manipulation.

## 🧩 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

1. JS creates 10 copies of a warning paragraph and inserts them into the page.

2. A modal appears after a 3-second delay.

3. Hovering over Decline flips the button order using a reverse class.

4. Submitting the form:
- Stops the page reload
- Reads the user’s name
- Shows 3 funny messages with delays
- Displays a GIF and claims their data was sold to Barbie 💅
